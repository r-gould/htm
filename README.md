An implementation of the Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) system: a self-supervised, non-probabilistic, non-gradient-based prediction algorithm inspired by the neocortex in the brain.

Description of the approach: https://r-gould.github.io/2023/08/03/understanding-htm.html

Work in progress:
* Vectorize spatial pooling and temporal memory algorithm?
* Performance analysis (currently limited by compute)
