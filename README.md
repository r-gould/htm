A description and implementation of the Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) system: a self-supervised, non-probabilistic, non-gradient-based prediction algorithm inspired by the neocortex in the brain.

Description of the approach: 

Work in progress, TODO:
* Implement boosting
* HTM learning quite slow, optimize spatial pooling and temporal memory algos, vectorize?
* Changes to BSOM text-to-snippet process
* Full train and evaluation (currently limited by compute)
